# clinRes

This repository contains an R package that I wrote while I was in a data analysis / research scientist role at NYU Langone department of Population Health and NYU Lutheran department of Clinical Research.

It was intended to streamline my daily work, which mostly involved relatively simple epidemiologic analyses of electronic health records and registry data. The package contains functions for presenting and formatting descriptive tables and results of linear models in publications. See for example PMID 29636398, 28273751, and 29550199.

The package is now archived and does not represent my current work or views on the best way of conducting and/or presenting such analyses.
